Game KSP 2 should've been: Interstellar, Colonies, and Multiplayer

Scripting for vehicle control system

Vehicles with scripts can then be automated

More flexible vehicle creation (also allowing nicer continuous surfaces) -> spacecraft, aircraft, boats, submarines, trains, land vehicles

# Colonies/Outposts
Mid to late game progression is centered around building and expanding outposts. Will need to set up outposts on starting planet to get more resources or better access to places and science experiments. Outposts can be in space (space stations or generation ships), airborne (cloud cities or big aircraft), underwater, underground, or on the surface. Small ships use same mechanics (i.e. need a food + water store and a heat sink)

## Core
Allows people to live and be able to work. Includes all the basics that a colony would need: entertainment, medicine, housing, etc. Above a certain size can start producing pop.

Consumes:
 - Food
 - Water
 - Power
 - Heat
Produces:
- Heat
Building requirements:
 - Metals
 - Oxygen

## Additional modules or separate outposts
- Thermal
- Power
- Food
- Science
- Mining
- Refining
- Vehicle Manufacturing
- Launching
- Vehicle Maintenance (Refueling + Fix vehicles that have been operating near their limits)
- Resource Storage
- Vehicle Storage

# Interstellar
Coordinate system centered on current vehicle/outpost

# Multiplayer
Going to be tricky with coordinate system and scale.
Determinism?

Time warp

Cooperative and competitive

# Future ideas
- Weather -> natural disasters (tsunamis, earthquakes, solar flares, hurricanes, asteroid collisions)
